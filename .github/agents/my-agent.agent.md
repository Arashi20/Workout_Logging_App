# My Agent

This agent checks all templates + app.py to see if the required features are indeed implemented into the web app. 
The features include: 
- A simple landing page with perhaps greeting and buttons to the different sections of the app (PRs tab, workout logging tab, workout programs tab, weight tracker tab).
- The main page where I can log my current workouts with an interactiver timer starting. I can add the different exercises im currently doing, the amount of sets (warmup or working) and reps, and when finished i tap the button and it logs the workout with total time etc.
- the PRs tab is a simple page that lists all my current PRs for all unique exercises i have added to the database.
- There should be an exercise list where I can see all unique exercises i have added to the database (with name, description, type of exercise). i can add extra exercises through the app itself
- The workout programs tab will list my current workout programs i have added to the system, which are custom programs like upper/lower, Push/pull/legs, etc.
- the weight tracker tab allows me to fill in my current weight, body fat percentage and visceral fat, which can then be tracked and visualized with a graph maybe.
- in order to acces the app’s functionalities i will first need to fill in the username and password on the login page (as it will be hosted online, i made sure only i can enter it).
